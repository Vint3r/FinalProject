That was successful and attractive, and the cats became the basis for a new breed: the Colorpoint Shorthair.  Eventually, other non-traditional colors were created. The breed was recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1964. The International Cat Association considers the Colorpoint a variety of Siamese, not a separate breed.',2,'Medium'),(188,'Cornish Rex',1,'Short','The playful, affectionate Cornish Rex is a small to medium-size cat with an extraordinary appearance, from his egg-shaped head and curly whiskers to his short coat with bent hairs. The unusual wavy coat comes in many colors and patterns, including bicolor (one color and white) and tortoiseshell.',2,'Short'),(189,'Devon Rex',1,'Short','With his high cheekbones, big eyes, long legs, slender body, and unusual hairstyle, the Devon Rex looks like the feline incarnation of waiflike model Kate Moss. Like his cousin, the Cornish Rex, the Devon has a wavy coat, but his has a looser curl than that of the Cornish.',2,'Small'),(190,'Egyptian Mau',0,'Short','The gentle Egyptian Mau is a feline track star. He has been clocked at 30 miles per hour and is possessed of what seem to be springs for legs, which catapult him to high places. He is the only domesticated cat with a naturally occurring spotted coat.',2,'Medium'),(191,'European Burmese',0,'Short','The European Burmese is a very affectionate, intelligent, and loyal cat. They thrive on companionship and will want to be with you, participating in everything you do. While they might pick a favorite family member, chances are that they will interact with everyone in the home, as well as any visitors that come to call. They are inquisitive and playful, even as adults. Expect them to be in your lap whenever you sit down and snuggle up next to you in bed. They become fast friends to other cats and even dogs, making them the perfect addition to your family.',2,'Medium'),(192,'Exotic',0,'Long','While Persians and their relatives have a laid-back, mellow personality, Exotics are also playful and enjoy a good game of catching the catnip mouse between bouts of catching a few ZZZs. Because of the American Shorthair influence, Exotics are reported to be somewhat livelier than Persians. Undoubtedly, the Exotic personality is, if not identical, very much like the Persian’s—laidback, loyal, sweet, and affectionate. They want to be involved in their favorite humans’ lives and will quietly follow them from room to room just to see what they are doing. They also enjoy hugs and cuddles, and lavish their humans with purrs and licks of affection until the thick coat drives them away to lounge on cool kitchen linoleum or cold fireplace bricks. Because of the short coat, their guardians can spend more time playing with their Exotics than grooming them.',2,'Large'),(193,'Havana Brown',0,'Medium','More distinctive than the muzzle, ears, or mink-like coat is the Havana Brown’s personality. Although still quite rare, Havanas have built an enthusiastic following. Havana Browns are affectionate, gentle, highly intelligent, and, unlike their Siamese compatriots, quiet. They are remarkably adaptable and agreeable cats, and adjust to almost any situation with poise and confidence. Havanas must have human interaction if they are to live happy, healthy lives. They crave attention from their human companions and are not content unless they can be by your side, helping you with your household tasks. Havanas love to reach out and touch their favorite humans; they often nudge their human friends with an out-stretched paw as if asking for attention. Fetch is a favorite Havana game, and they can often be found carrying toys and stray objects around in their mouths. If you’ve misplaced a sock or some other small, easily carried object, check your Havana’s cat bed. You might find that it has magically found its way there.',2,'Medium'),(194,'Japanese Bobtail',0,'Medium','This fun-loving cat brings good luck to everyone who is fortunate enough to live with him — or so it’s believed in his homeland of Japan. It must be true, because who wouldn’t enjoy spending time with a happy, playful cat who makes friends with everyone. His coat can be short or long and comes in calico as well as other colors and patterns.',2,'Medium'),(195,'Khao Manee',0,'Short','Built for warm weather, the Khao Manee is a lithe, muscular, athletic cat of medium boning. They are devoted to their owners and are curious, intelligent cats who have an enduring sense of naughtiness. They are quite the inquisitive cat and love to play a good game of fetch before curling up with you for a warm nap. Known as the “White Gem”, the Khao Manee was rumored to be highly coveted by Thai royalty is thought to bring good luck to those forunate enough to have one.',2,'Medium'),(196,'Korat',0,'Short','In his home country of Thailand, the Korat is a living symbol of luck and prosperity. He is quieter than the Siamese, to whom he is related, but he definitely will let you know what he’s thinking. His compact, muscular body wears a short, easy-care coat in bluish-gray tipped with silver.',2,'Medium'),(197,'LaPerm',0,'Medium','LaPerms are gentle, people-oriented cats that are affectionate without being overly demanding or clingy. They adore human companionship and adapt well to indoor or apartment living as long as they get the requisite amount of playing and pampering. Like most cats, LaPerms develop the closest bond with their human friends when they get regular human interaction and affection. LaPerms are agile and active. Like their barn cat ancestors, they enjoy a good game of chase, and love pouncing on the catnip mouse.',2,'Small'),(198,'Lykoi',0,'Short','The Lykoi cat is considered to be a partially hairless cat. There is no true undercoat, and parts of the body, such as the eyes, chin, nose, muzzle and behind the ears are commonly hairless. The exposed skin, ears and nose feel similar to leather, and although the skin is normally pink, it can darken with exposure to sun. Most cats will molt some or all of their coat, occasionally leaving them to appear even more naked than usual. This is normal for Lykoi cats, and not associated with a disease process.',2,'Small'),(199,'Manx',0,'Double-coat short','The friendly, affectionate Manx, who hails from the Isle of Man, is best known for his taillessness. He has a solid body, round head, widely spaced ears, large, round eyes and a thick coat that comes in many colors and patterns, including tabby, tortoiseshell and calico. The Cymric (pronounced kim-rick) is the longhaired variety of the Manx. Other than coat length, the two breeds are identical.',2,'Medium'),(200,'Norwegian Forest Cat',0,'Double-coat long','Despite the wild years in the forests of Norway—or perhaps because of it—they would much rather cuddle than prowl. Perhaps, because of years spent in Norway’s harsh climate, nothing fazes them much, either. They take new people and new situations in stride; as cats go, Forest Cats are the strong, silent types. They are conversely great purrers, particularly when perched beside their favorite humans. Outgoing and gregarious, they tend not to bond with one person, but rather love everyone unconditionally and enthusiastically.',2,'Large'),(201,'Ocicat',1,'Short','Ocicats may look like they walk on the wild side, but they are affectionate, adaptable, curious, and playful, and possess strong devotion to their human companions. Highly intelligent, active, and social, Ocicats quickly learn to respond to their names and can be taught a variety of tricks, including coming on command. Begging for food is another trick that Ocicats master with very little prompting.',2,'Large'),(202,'Oriental',1,'Medium','Do not get an Oriental if living with a chatty busybody would drive you insane. On the other hand, if you enjoy having someone to talk to throughout the day, an Oriental can be your best friend. Just be sure you have time to spend with this demanding and social cat. Orientals do not like being left alone for long periods, and if you work during the day it can be smart to get two of them so they can keep each other company.',2,'Medium'),(203,'Persian',0,'Long','If you want your cats bouncing around like hyperactive popcorn, don’t adopt a Persian. Persians are perfect companions, if you like placid, sweet-tempered cats. Don’t count on using your Persian pal as a furry doorstop, however. They love to play between periods of regal lounging on your favorite davenport. Proponents say that Persians do not deserve their furniture-with-fur reputation; they are intelligent, just not as inquisitive as some breeds, and not as active.',2,'Large'),(204,'Ragamuffin',0,'Long','Don’t confuse the longhaired Ragamuffin with his cousin the Ragdoll. The two are separate breeds, although they are similar in temperament and appearance. Large and affectionate, this is a classic lap cat who loves being cuddled. The Ragamuffin is a big kitty who comes in more colors and patterns than the Ragdoll, although not all of them are accepted by every cat breed association.',2,'Large'),(205,'Ragdoll',0,'Long','The Ragdoll is a well-balanced cat with no extreme features. They are a medium to large, moderately longhaired, blue-eyed pointed cats. The point markings may be covered by a range of white overlay patterns. Ragdolls are slow maturing, reaching full coat and color at about three years of age. The Ragdoll is an affectionate and intelligent cat, giving the impression of graceful movement and subdued power, striking in appearance.',2,'Large'),(206,'Russian Blue',1,'Double-coat short','Russian Blues are known to be quiet, gentle, genteel cats, and are usually reserved or absent when strangers come to call. When they’re with their own beloved and trusted humans, however, they are playful and affectionate. Russian Blues are active but not overly so. They like nothing better than to spend time pouncing on a favorite toy or chasing sunbeams. They willingly entertain themselves, but prefer games in which their preferred people take an active role. When you’re home, they follow you around, unobtrusive but ever-present companions.',2,'Medium'),(207,'Scottish Fold',0,'Long','Scottish Folds are typically intelligent, sweet-tempered, soft-spoken, and easily adaptable to new people and situations. They are loyal and tend to bond with one person in the household. While they will usually allow others to cuddle and pet them, their primary attachment becomes quickly clear as they single out their chosen human. They thrive on attention, but it must be on their own terms. Despite their devotion, they are not clingy, demanding cats and usually prefer to be near you rather than on your lap. They enjoy a good game of catch the catnip mouse now and then as well, and keep their playful side well into adulthood.',2,'Medium'),(208,'Selkirk Rex',0,'Long','One may be at first attracted to the Selkirk’s cute and curly exterior, but these cats also make champion companions. Selkirks can be mellow cats with a generous measure of love and affection for their human companions. Very people-oriented, they stay loyal and loving all their lives. They are people-oriented cats that enjoy spending time with their preferred persons.',2,'Large'),(209,'Siamese',1,'Short','Siamese Cats are incredibly social, intelligent and vocal—they’ll talk to anyone who wants to listen, and even those who don’t. They also play well with other cats, dogs and children. In fact, they thrive on companionship, so it’s a good idea to get them a playmate to interact with throughout the day. Although they’re active and curious, they also love curling up on their human’s lap or snuggling up next to them in bed.',2,'Medium'),(210,'Siberian',1,'Triple-coat Long','Siberians are affectionate cats with a good dose of personality and playfulness. They are amenable to handling, and it is noted that Siberians have a fascination with water, often dropping toys into their water dishes or investigating bathtubs before they’re dry. Siberians seem very intelligent, with the ability to problem-solve to get what they want.',2,'Large'),(211,'Singapura',0,'Short','At home in any situation, Puras love to be the center of attention, and they don’t seem to know the word stranger; they’re at the door with you to welcome anyone, whether they’re friends and family, or door to door salespeople. They’re curious, people-oriented, and remain playful well into old age. Their voices are quiet and unobtrusive, and they trust their humans implicitly.',2,'Small'),(212,'Somali',0,'Long','Like the Abyssinian, the Somali is vigorous and animated, has a keen sense of feline humor, and a real need for play. Everything is a game to a Somali; some will play fetch, but many prefer to chase that ball down the hall and then bat it up and down, around and around, until it rolls back to your feet for you to throw again—and again. If it rolls under something from which they can’t retrieve it, then back they’ll come and give you a wide-eyed stare or a gentle tap so you’ll get up and put the ball back in play. Wands and fishing poles with feathers are a huge hit; you’ll need a lockable cupboard for when playtime is over.',2,'Medium'),(213,'Sphynx',1,'Bald','To say Sphynxes are lively is an understatement; they perform monkey-like aerialist feats from the top of doorways and bookshelves. Very devoted and loyal, they follow their humans around, wagging their tails doggy fashion, kneading with their padded toes, and purring with delight at the joy of being near their beloved humans. They demand your unconditional attention and are as mischievous (and lovable) as children. And despite all that and their alien appearance, they are still entirely cats, with all the mystery and charm that has fascinated humankind for thousands of years. While the Sphynx may not be for everyone, its unique appearance and charming temperament has won it an active, enthusiastic following.',2,'Medium'),(214,'Tonkinese',0,'Short','The Tonkinese craves, and returns, affection and companionship. Unlike the rest of your busy family, this cat will always join you for dinner. Tonks have an unflagging enthusiasm for life and life’s pleasures, and love interactive toys, such as human fingers and the tails of its cat companions. It makes every close encounter a game.',2,'Medium'),(215,'Toybob',0,'Short','Toybob are small cats, no bigger than a 3-6 month old kitten of a normally developed domestic cat, with a short strong and muscular body, short bobbed tail consisting of several kinked vertebras. Toybobs are very affectionate and obedient to their human companions with an even temperament. Despite its small size, they are also very active, playful and agile.',2,'Small'),(216,'Turkish Angora',0,'Medium','Angoras seem to invoke strong responses in their humans with their symmetry, intelligence, and devotion. Angoras bond with their owners completely; an Angora is not happy unless they are right in the middle of whatever you’re doing. They enjoy a good conversation and can keep up their end of the discussion with the best of them.',2,'Medium'),(217,'Turkish Van',0,'Medium','While you might be drawn to the Van for its fascination with water, you’ll fall in love with this cat for its other qualities. Vans are energetic, agile, and intelligent. They are extremely healthy and “get along with people swimmingly,” notes one Van owner. You may need a few months of working out to keep up with them, however; Vans are famous for their action-packed temperaments. They are talkative, demand attention from their humans, and show great gusto at dinnertime. Vans are known for their deep attachment to their preferred people, and sometimes that makes transferring a Van from one household to another difficult. They tend to pick out one or two people in the household, usually the ones who deal with them initially, and bond with them forever.',2,'Long'),(218,'Javanese',1,'Medium','Javanese cats, like their Balinese relatives, are playful, devoted, and always eager to tell you their views on life, love, and what you’ve served them for dinner. Javanese (and their Siamese relatives) have a fascination with food, and, while some will burn off the extra calories in playful antics, care must be taken that the less active don’t turn into butterballs.',2,'Short'),(219,'Mixed cat breed',0,'Unknown','N/A',2,'Unknown');

My volunteer friends like to say \"pretty as a penny\" because I am so adorable. I am a sweet-faced 14-year-old, white and beige Lhasa Apso and Shih Tzu mix. I am a small girl, weighing 15 lbs. I found myself at MaxFund after being surrendered through no fault of my own: my previous owner had to move and could not bring me along. I am a mellow and sweet girl, who does well with other fur babies. I lived in a home with two other dogs and I was well-behaved so I could fit in at just about any household. Make sure to bring your dogs in to meet me to make sure we get along great! It is unknown how I do with cats, but the staff could get me tested to make sure I will behave myself around cats. I would love to bond with you and become lifelong pals. I also do well with kids, but remember I am an older lady so they must be gentle with me please! Another advantage to adopting an older dog is that I have basic knowledge of commands and I am housebroken! Since I am on the older side, this comes with changes in my body as well. I do have a condition called Cushing\'s disease which is a hormonal imbalance that requires I take medication every day. This would cost my owner about $50 a month. That is a small price to pay compared to all the love and joy I will bring into your life. I am a very cute and unique looking girl, I do have a head tilt that makes me look like I\'m questioning you all the time, but promise I\'m not a judgy girl. I\'m taking getting older like a champ and would love to spend the rest of my days in a comfortable and loving home where I can give and receive tons of love and attention. Would you like to spend my retirement time with me? I hope I am lucky enough to find my forever very soon. I am currently in a foster home, but you can still visit with me! Provide your information to the front desk and they can let you know how to meet with me! Have you ever considered helping save the life of an older dog through adoption? Today could be the day you reach that goal!',0,2,146),(10,'Jazzy','Small',14,5,'Tan and White',1,'None','What\'s up, people! My name is Jazzy, nice to meet you! I am a cute, tan and white chihuahua mix. I am a 5-year-old, small sized girl who weighs 14 lbs. Not too teeny, but not too large either. I am just the perfect size! I found my way to MaxFund after making a long journey from New Mexico, where the shelter I was at no longer had room for me. Thankfully, I was able to make it to Colorado where I can start my new life in this beautiful state.\nWhen I first arrived, I was very nervous. After some time, I have started to show more of my personality to my staff and volunteer friends. I am quite the sweet, little girl! I love to be pet, especially on my tummy! I also love to show off my hand-shaking skills, I can prop myself up and shake both paws with you at the same time! I am a character, that is for sure!\nIt is unknown how I get along with other dogs, since I haven\'t had a ton of interaction with other dogs while at MaxFund. If I will potentially be gaining fur siblings, make sure to bring them in to meet me and see how great we can get along. If my sibling might be a cat, the staff here at the shelter can get me a cat test. Just ask the front desk!\nI would love to go to a home where I can be someone\'s best friend and companion. I am a great lap dog, just ask my volunteer friends! I would love to chill out at home and enjoy each other\'s company. Do I sound like the perfect lady for you?

My name is Nika and I am a part of the very special Old Lady Club we have here at Maxfund. I am a beautiful, 7-year old, black Labrador and Akita mix. I am a large gal, weighing in at about 55 lbs. I found my way to MaxFund after being surrendered through no fault of my own. My previous owner just did not have any time to care for me.\nAlthough I am older and my face has already started to go grey, I have the spirit of a pup! Do you know what the best thing about adopting an older dog is? Well, I\'ll tell ya! I already know all of my manners and basic commands. I am even already crate trained! I am ready to go to a home and behave while still bringing some fun into your life.\nThere are a few unique things that should be considered when adopting a senior dog like me as well. I\'m not as physically young as I used to be so my body has gone through some changes. I do have a little bit of urinary incontinence which is very well maintained when I take Proin everyday. It is an easy chewable to give me, and costs about $50 for a three month supply.\nI am not a huge fan of going to the vet, this makes me very nervous. Who likes to get poked and examined, anyway? Because of this, I have one other medication that I take when I am supposed to visit the vet. I\'m given Trazadone to help ease my nerves. This med costs about $15-$20 a bottle which would last quite a while given that I only have to go to the vet a few times a year.\nI am a very sweet girl who loves to bond with my human companions. I love humans of all sizes and ages! Being pet is my absolute favorite thing. I would love to snuggle up on the couch and enjoy each other\'s company this holiday season. If you\'re looking to play around and run around outside, I am also your gal! I am up for just about anything.\nI am more picky with my dog friends, so make sure to bring your fur babies with you to see we get along. The staff is unsure of how I react to cats, but I can be tested at our cat shelter upon request. Let the front desk know!\nAre you looking for the perfect balance of excitement and mellow in your life? I may just be the perfect match for you. Please visit with me today so I can show off for the Old Ladies here. I will be waiting for ya!',0,2,103),(12,'Moses','Average',50,5,'Grey and White',1,'Might be scared of other dogs, prefers female and smaller dogs','Hiya!

I\'m Moses and I\'m 5-year-old, energetic, 50 lbs. boy that is on the lookout for his forever home. I\'m a very strong fella that would be a great addition to an athletic family/person. Because of my size and energy, I would do better in a home that has a yard. I am crate trained, potty trained and just a well behaved boy overall. I can be 50/50 with some other dogs (I prefer females) so I do ask that you bring in any potential future sibling to make sure we get along. I do great with smaller dogs, cats, and children!

She would love to be on your lap, near you or playing with you as much as possible. She gets along well with her feline roommates. She is FIV+ which is the Feline Immunodeficiency Virus.

She doesn\'t care for really young, loud or over-active children, but should be OK with older, calm children who would give her space when she needs it and be gentle with her.
